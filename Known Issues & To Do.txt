Biggest known issue by far: Myself. I only 'know' how to read tweak code/scripts. I'm too stupid to write them, or at least write them properly.


I also, ovbiously, have no idea what I'm doing. But, I'm learning.


Need/want to change NPC's in Autosmurf scripts from ("name") to (NPC.Name)


Have multiple Autosmurf scripts. Testing to see which works best / most efficiently.


Need to edit Autosmurf scripts to fix "roles" Change OtherChars to/from NonSorcChar.


TCP/IPHost and Client quitting scripts only work when bot switches to MF mode.


Still need to babysit the bots for at least Acts 1-4 in normal. (Autosmurf issue)


If one bot chickens, it will hang indefinitely until leader restarts game. (Autosmurf issue)


If bot hangs, restarting all bots or reloading all bots won't fix issue some of the time. (Unknown issue. Cache or Autosmurf? Deleting Logs and .json files doens't fix)


Need to just let the bot force close itself from being idle too long. 
This seems to fix the issue 100% of the time as long as all of the bots are in/have the same: Area, quests (started and finished), waypoints, etc.
