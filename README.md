My own personal kolbot setup project. Designed specifically for TCP/IP play.

My goal here is to do as little setup work as possible and be able to just run the bots and watch them do their thing.

It is very much a work in progress. Feedback and tips are appreciated as I'm learning on the fly here.

Credits go to: Kolton, Blizzhackers, GZer, Dark-f, JeanMax, Alogwe, Imba, Larryw, Noah, QQValpen, Sam, YGM, SiC-666, Jaenster, and anyone else that I'm not aware of who had a part in making/coding/scripting D2BS/D2Bot/D2NT/ETAL/kolbot/Autosmurf etc etc. I'm just an idiot tinkering with shit.

Use at your own risk.

## Instructions 

1. Backup any existing character save files you have

2. Place botting folder wherever your little heart desires

3. Copy Save files from the LvL 1 Char Reset files folder into your current save directory

4. Open the "profile.json" file in the KolbotFullAutosmurf/data/ folder

5. Replace "YOUR D2 PATH HERE" with your current location of your Diablo 2 "Game.exe" file is located example: From "YOUR D2 PATH HERE" to "D:\Diablo II\Game.exe"

6. Run D2Bot.exe

7. Select all bot profiles and press the Start button

8. Watch bots do their thing

9. ???
